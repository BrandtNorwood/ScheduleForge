uid - 8 digit integer for Unique identification
    Unique identifyer for users and shifts.
    A check should be run during generation to ensure no overlap within the same Array
    Overlap between shifts on different employees are fine.
    Each employee should have a unique uid and their shift UIDs shouldn't overlap with the empUID or eachother
